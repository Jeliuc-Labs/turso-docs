Turso provides multiple official SDKs that you can use to connect a local or remote database, as well as support for embedded databases. If you're using a language or framework that isn't supported with an official driver, you can use Turso over HTTP.

Turso SDKs are fully compatible with [libSQL](/libsql), so you can use the same SDK to connect to a local database ([SQLite](/local-development#sqlite)), [libSQL server](/local-development#libsql-server), a remote database, or an [embedded replica](/features/embedded-replicas).

## Community SDKs

These SDKs are community-driven and don't come with official Turso support.
